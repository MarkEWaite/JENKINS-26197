[JENKINS-32570](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-32570) - tags don't push

The bug report claims that tags don't push through an https authenticated
URL. I can't duplicate the problem.

This test uses the JENKINS-32570 branch for verification.  Verification
tests run on different Jenkins servers, all monitoring the same GitHub
repository.
