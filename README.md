[JENKINS-32577](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-32577) - excluded user ignored if regex branch to build

The bug claims that user exclusion is ignored for a regex based branch
name. This job attempts show it is working.

This branch is hosted on github.com so that I can include the test case
in my docker image.

The cs/relase-2.0 branch is hosted on mark-pc1.markwaite.net for faster
access when I'm working at home.
